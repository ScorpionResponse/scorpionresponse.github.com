As any
good site creator I wanted to make sure my favicon.ico and robots.txt files
were in place.  Also I despise seeing the 404 errors pop up as I play around
with my site. Pelican doesn't immediately make it obvious how to accomplish
this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of Googling, I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/commit/04da794b6bae6f151a946b6edfca7e8d01a6f9f3"&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt;.
In my /content folder I created a new folder called 'extra' (though that could
have been named anything I figured I would follow the example).  There are two
files in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
favicon.ico
robots.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we simply add a line to the Pelican settings file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
FILES_TO_COPY = (('extra/robots.txt', 'robots.txt'), ('extra/favicon.ico', 'favicon.ico'),)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a quick &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;make html&lt;/tt&gt; and we're ready to roll.&lt;/p&gt;

early 2000's.  I generally try to keep a low profile on the internet, but
lately I've started to feel as if I should participate a little more in
my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site will mostly be a dumping ground for the random thoughts I have and
projects that I work on. So far I haven't found a great way to keep track of
the things that I might want to refer to again.  Hopefully this will work and
no one else will ever find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is powered by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.  So far, I
have found it fairly easy to get set up.  If I run into any snags, this'll be
the place I document them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;
