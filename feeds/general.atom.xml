The blog died immediately after
I created it.  Probably it will remain that way, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm just putting together the update process with new versions of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; so that I can update the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scorpionresponse.com/pages/my-resume.html"&gt;resume page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

early 2000's.  I generally try to keep a low profile on the internet, but
lately I've started to feel as if I should participate a little more in
my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site will mostly be a dumping ground for the random thoughts I have and
projects that I work on. So far I haven't found a great way to keep track of
the things that I might want to refer to again.  Hopefully this will work and
no one else will ever find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is powered by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.  So far, I
have found it fairly easy to get set up.  If I run into any snags, this'll be
the place I document them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;
